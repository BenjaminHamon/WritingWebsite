                    <p class="emphasis-italic emphasis-bold">Saying “I love you” can be hard, even for best friends.</p>
                    <p class="emphasis-italic">It’s been years since Kate and Sara called themselves best friends. Life has happened and they’ve drifted away from each other. Sara’s become an adult, discovered new things about herself, experienced love. She’s decided she’s going to make her own happiness and build herself the perfect love story, except she’s as shy as ever, hopelessly stuck in the daily routine, and not quite confident enough to put herself out there.</p>
                    <p class="emphasis-italic">During one fateful winter, Sara reunites with Kate, and their bond is reborn as if the time apart never happened. Sara’s happy once again, and her affection quickly grows beyond simple friendship, so much so that she starts decisively involving herself in Kate’s life. However, dealing with Kate might be more complicated than Sara imagined.</p>
